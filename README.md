<h1>Sayu, the bot that speaks for you</h1>

Hello there! This is Sayu, my first ever Discord bot utilizing the Discordjs library. It's a very simple bot that takes a private message from a user and relays it into a channel. The user and the channel IDs are determined in the config.json file in this repo.
